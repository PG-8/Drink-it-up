**UP NEXT**

- ~Fix NaN assignment when initiating the page for the first time~
- ~Historical data (30 past days -or less- considering proportions)~
- Historical data reset every month or week to display accurate data (or just keep last 10 days)
- Test background chart feature using mockup button (+1 day)
- ~Replace timer with hourglass icon:hover tooltip~
- ~Custom value button~
- Undo button
- Styling (mobile friendliness)
- Validate input field
- Merge/bundle/clean code
- **REMOVE** static values from scripts (eg. arrays, variables..)
- **OPTIONAL** refactoring using React
