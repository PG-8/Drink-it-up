**ISSUES TO FIX**

- Find workaround for the array called "objectForTest" which is initialized with 31 zeros in it

**UP NEXT**

- Historical data reset every month or week to display accurate data (or just keep last 10 days)
- Styling (mobile friendliness)
- Validate input field
- **REMOVE** static values from scripts (eg. arrays, variables..)
- **OPTIONAL** refactoring using React
