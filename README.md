# Drink-it-up

**Single page app to keep track of water drank during the day. Uses localStorage to memorize values if you leave the page.**

**ISSUES TO FIX**

- Find workaround for the array called "objectForTest" which is initialized with 31 zeros in it
- Rename non meaningfully named variables and functions in script.js
- Rename non meaningfully named classes and IDs in index.html and style.css
- ~Remove commented out sections for development purposes~
- Remove garbage code playing hide and seek within the collection
- ~Raising water z-index to adjust (better looking if placed behind the historical values?)~

**UP NEXT**

- ~Fix NaN assignment when initiating the page for the first time~
- ~Historical data (30 past days -or less- considering proportions)~
- Historical data reset every month or week to display accurate data (or just keep last 10 days)
- Test background chart feature using mockup button (+1 day)
- ~Replace timer with hourglass icon:hover tooltip~
- ~Custom value button~
- Undo button
- Styling (mobile friendliness)
- Validate input field
- Merge/bundle/clean code
- **REMOVE** static values from scripts (eg. arrays, variables..)
- **OPTIONAL** refactoring using React
